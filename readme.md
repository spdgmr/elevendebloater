Windows "debloater" specifically for Windows 11 (now with 10 support) that relies on the App Installer and "winget"
Made this just because I had some free time and was fucking around with 11 build 21996.1

### Pros 
- Very easy to customize depending on what you want to delete & what to keep
- Can easily be fixed when more shit is added to Windows 11.
- Batch script so the "source" is always public
- Now allows easy reinstallation of deleted apps
- Doesn't require admin if you manually enable it

### Cons 
- Requires modification to the script if you want customization
- Maybe messy code

### Before running
Please run "winget list" in CMD and accept the terms. Otherwise nothing will be deleted.
Actually 0.95 may have fixed this problem by doing it automatically. Still try this if you can't get it to work!

### Mirrors:
[Directly from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speediegamer/elevendebloater/main/ElevenDebloater-0.95.bat), [.zip from GitHub](https://github.com/speediegamer/elevendebloater/archive/refs/tags/0.95.zip), [Unofficial SoftPedia mirror](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/ElevenDebloater.shtml#download).

### How to use
Download the latest script from one of the mirros above and run the .bat as Administrator. Then simply follow the instructions on-screen.

### About SoftPedia
The SoftPedia mirror is unofficial and I never gave them permission to host my software but I greatly appreciate it even though they didn't ask for permission.
I am however not responsible for any malware found in their version. To be safe, grab the version from [my](https://github.com/speediegamer) GitHub

### NOTE: I am not responsible for any data loss caused by this script. I have tested this on many Windows 11 installs and even use it on my main Windows 10 install but please have common sense. Thank you!
